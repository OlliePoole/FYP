Part 1a
The first file should be called team.py and will contain a class that should be called Team.   
Class Team needs to keep track of the statistics.

Create a file called team.py containing the class description for Team.  



Part 1b
Create another file called teamtest.py.   This file should contain code to test your Team class. 
The code in teamtest.py should import Team and create a variable of type Team then use the get methods to display the initial values of the attributes.  
It should then call the win, loss and draw methods before using the get methods again to display the final values of the attributes which should be:
wins	1
draws	1
losses	1
played	1
total	2 

Part 2
The next file will be called league.py, which will import Team and contain the description for class League.
Class League will contain one attribute which will be a list called table.   
League will contain methods which will carry out the following actions:
Construct the class
Remove a team from the list
Return the position of a team in the list or -1 if the team is not present.
Update the statistics for the two teams involved when a result is entered, or display a message if a team is not in the league.  HINT: this should first use the find position method to identify where the teams to be modified are in the list.
Display the list
Save the list data to a file
Load the list data from a file

Part 3
The main program should be in a file called hockeyleague.py and will import League.   This file provides the user interface and uses League to carry out the actions.   The interface for this should be a standard text interface as has been used in examples throughout the course
